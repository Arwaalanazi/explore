# Exercises Week 1

## Todo list

1. Intro to HTML/CSS
2. CSS Challenges
3. Code along
4. Challenges

### **1. Intro to HTML/CSS**

The following course provides a very practical way of learning HTML. Have a go:

- [Khan Academy: Intro to HTML/CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)

### **2. CSS Challenges**

In order to improve you need to practice a lot! In the following challenges you'll work with CSS and solve challenges that you may encounter whenever you are building a webpage:

- [CSS Challenges](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges): Solve challenge #1 to #6.

### **3. Code along**

A big part of learning web development is through learning by example. In the following video you'll learn how to build a simple website, using basic HTML & CSS.

> The way to learn best from code alongs is to type out the code yourself while watching. Afterwards, try to add a couple of features to the end result to really have the learnings set in. Have a look at this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-from-coding-tutorials-and-avoid-tutorial-hell/) that explains the pitfalls of using code alongs from the perspective of a learner.

### **4. Challenges**

The following challenges require you to combine your HTML and CSS knowledge to make a webpage. The instructions here are more requirements than a very defined exercise which is closer to what developers do! These are probably too much for one week, but try to do as many of them as you can as each of the numbered challenges are ones we feel add something to your knowledge!

- [Codecademy Challenges](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/): Challenge #2, #4, #5, #8

## Extra options

The above is your todo list, but sometimes they do not match up well with the way you learn. Sometimes it goes too fast or sometimes the teacher in a video does not explain it in the way to make it click. That's why we also provide extra options here for you to look at if you are struggling to understand what is happening:

- [Mimo app](https://getmimo.com/) - If you are on the go a lot this is a great app to have on your phone to keep practicing. Choose the Web development path and get it out whenever you need to wait somewhere!
