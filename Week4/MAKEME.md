### 1. 30 days of JavaScript

So you will notice that we are skipping Loops here. We opt to skip this for now as you will most likely not need it for the final assignment when applying to HYF. It is the last big building block of JavaScript though and if you want to go a little further then have a look at it! We will go through it in the main curriculum at any rate.

- [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md). Do day 7 and 8.

### 2. Exercises

In the following exercises you'll learn how to use different JavaScript concepts to solve common computational problems.

- [Learn-js](https://www.learn-js.org/). Do the following `Learn the basics` exercises:
  - Objects
  - Functions
- [Codecademy: Introduction to Functions](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/intro-to-functions).
- [jshero.net](https://www.jshero.net/en/success.html). Do exercises #6-#46

The above should give you some good practice again. If you have extra time and want to continue practicing, have a look at the following:

- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript). You can choose whichever ones you feel are challenging enough.

## Finished?

Are you finished with going through the exercises? Well done, you have now gone through all of the materials in the starter repository of HYF!!! You should be proud of yourself as this is not easy.

We hope you enjoyed the module and have a better idea of what web development is all about. If you are now excited to become a web developer then look at our [website](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/apply) when the next step will happen.

In the meantime you can continue learning by looking at the following resources. These will give you a head start with the curriculum!

- [The JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/) - JavaScript30 is a great set of tutorials that build simple frontend applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript!
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Code wars is a website where you can solve exercises and rank up! When signing up, only choose JavaScript to really focus the problems on learning to solve problems in it. You can later change it to other technologies when you get more familiar.
- [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md) - We have already done some of the days during this module, but it would be good to continue with the 30 Days of JavaScript course!
