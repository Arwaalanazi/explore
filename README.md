# HackYourFuture start

** UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

This module is your first look at what being a developer is and how the HackYourFuture program works. Before applying to a class we suggest you complete this module in your own time. By completing it you will have a better idea of what will be expected of you throughout the 7 months of studying at HackYourFuture so you can make an informed decision if you want to commit your time to it.

If you haven't yet, please fill out the questionnaire [here TODO](TODO) that will inform you about the selection process and how that applies to your situation. When completing it you will receive an invite to the HackYourFuture slack channel with all applicants so you can get help if you need it. There will also be a weekly session posted there on Sunday that you can join with professional developers to get help.

## Module overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice. JS gives us the power to perform logical operations to react to what the user is doing.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing and the JS the brain!

This module will handle the very basics of what is called `frontend` (as opposed to `backend` which we will handle in the HackYourFuture curriculum). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

### Learning Goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Be able to write syntactically correct `HTML` and `CSS`
- Understand what is meant by `responsive` web development
- Know your way around `Visual Studio Code`
- Feel comfortable working with your `browser's inspector`
- Know what we mean with `variables`, `operators`, `objects` and `arrays` in `JavaScript`
- Know how to write `if/else` statements in `JavaScript`

### Repository content

This repository, as every repository in the HackYourFuture curriculum consists of 2 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture teachers. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's practical side. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.

We provide a subset of materials that touches on all the concepts we would like you to learn and do. This is enough for some, but not for others, it is up to you to define what you need more information on. If you do need more information then you can search the internet for more explanations. Luckily there is a lot of information out there so it should not be too hard!
